# Extension Icon

For publishing, you should add a 128x128 pixel icon file (PNG format) to represent your extension in the marketplace.

Place your icon file in the root directory and name it `icon.png`, then reference it in package.json with:

```json
"icon": "icon.png"
```

The icon should represent your extension - perhaps a train or locomotive symbol for the ENG language support.
