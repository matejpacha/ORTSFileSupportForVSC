feat: Release v1.5.4 - Enhanced SMS and CVF file folding support

Major folding improvements for Train Simulator Sound Management System (SMS) and Cabview (CVF) files, resolving user-reported folding issues.

## ðŸ”§ Fixed Issues

### SMS File Folding Support
- **Root Cause**: Folding regex patterns not properly recognizing SMS-specific structures
- **Resolution**: Enhanced language configuration for SMS syntax patterns
- **Structures Now Foldable**:
  - `Tr_SMS ( ... )` - Main sound management container
  - `ScalabiltyGroup ( ... )` - Priority-based sound grouping
  - `Activation ( ... )` / `Deactivation ( ... )` - State management
  - `Stream ( ... )` / `Streams ( ... )` - Audio stream configuration
  - `Trigger ( ... )` / `Triggers ( ... )` - Sound event triggers
  - `SoundLoop ( ... )` - Looping audio definitions
  - `FrequencyCurve( ... )` / `VolumeCurve( ... )` - Audio curves
  - `CurvePoints ( ... )` - Curve point definitions
  - `Variable ( ... )` - Variable-controlled sounds
  - `PlayOneShot ( ... )` - Single-play audio events

### CVF File Folding Support  
- **Root Cause**: Similar regex pattern recognition issues for cabview structures
- **Resolution**: Improved folding configuration for CVF control hierarchies
- **Structures Now Foldable**:
  - `Tr_CabViewFile ( ... )` - Main cabview container
  - `CabViewControls ( ... )` - Control definitions container
  - `Digital ( ... )` - Digital display controls
  - `MultiStateDisplay ( ... )` - Multi-state visual elements
  - `Lever ( ... )` - Lever control definitions
  - `Dial ( ... )` - Gauge and dial controls
  - `TwoState ( ... )` / `TriState ( ... )` - State-based controls
  - `PositiveColour ( ... )` - Color configuration blocks
  - `States ( ... )` - State definition containers
  - `State ( ... )` - Individual state definitions

## ðŸš€ Technical Improvements

### Language Configuration Enhancements
